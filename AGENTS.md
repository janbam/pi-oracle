# pi-oracle Project Instructions

This file contains project-specific guidance for this repository.

## Project map
- `extensions/oracle/index.ts` registers the pi extension.
- `extensions/oracle/lib/` contains the agent-facing tools, slash commands, config, queue/job state, runtime/profile coordination, and poller logic.
- `extensions/oracle/worker/` contains the detached browser worker, auth bootstrap, browser UI helpers, cookie policy, and artifact heuristics.
- `extensions/oracle/shared/` contains cross-process lifecycle, observability, process, and state-coordination helpers used by both extension and worker code.
- `prompts/` contains the `/oracle` and `/oracle-followup` prompt templates.
- `scripts/oracle-sanity.ts` is the main regression/source-contract sanity harness; `npm run verify:oracle` is the local full gate.
- `README.md` is the user-facing entry point; `docs/ORACLE_DESIGN.md` is the durable design/source-of-truth detail.

## Single-operator ownership
- Treat this repository as single-operator: no human or external agent is working here except the current pi agent.
- Assume every lingering change, background process, temp file, queue entry, job directory, or other artifact was created by a prior version of you or by one of your delegated runs.
- You own reconciliation and cleanup for that state. Do not attribute unexplained repo state to another person.

## Extension testing feedback
- Pre-commit requirement for any code changes: always test with isolated `pi` agent sessions that load this local version of the extension.
- Use those isolated sessions to validate the changed behavior works as expected end-to-end, not just through local unit/sanity coverage.
- For these isolated-session validation runs, use the `instant` or `thinking_light` preset.
- During those tests, feel free to ask the agents you are exercising for suggestions and feedback about the tool.
- Ask specifically about friction points such as clunky behavior, uninformative output, workflows that feel slower with no clear gain, or anything else that seems off during real use.

## Temporary working files
- `progress.md` and `review.md` are temporary working artifacts.
- If `progress.md` exists, read it at the start of a continuation to recover current branch/task state; keep it concise and current during active work.
- Do not put changelog/history in `AGENTS.md`; use `progress.md` for transient handoff state and delete it once the work is committed or no longer useful.
- Ignore temporary artifacts locally or delete them once they have been consumed.
- Do not leave temporary working files around as untracked repo noise after they are no longer useful.

## Grok UI debugging

Grok's web UI is volatile — model menu items, labels, and popups change frequently.
When Grok model selection or upload flow breaks, use the **dev-browser** skill for low-level debugging:

1. Start the dev-browser server: `cd ~/src/dev-browser/skills/dev-browser && bash server.sh`
2. Use `npx tsx` scripts with `@/client.js` to navigate, snapshot, and click elements
3. The Playwright-based browser gives full DOM access and stable selectors
4. Use `page.accessibility.snapshot({ interestingOnly: true })` to get the ARIA snapshot matching what `parseSnapshotEntries` processes
5. Compare snapshot output against selectors in `run-job.mjs` (model select, Attach button, upload input)
6. Once fixed, test via oracle_submit to confirm the automation works end-to-end
