description: Prepare and dispatch a ChatGPT or Grok web oracle job
argument-hint: <request>
---
You are preparing an /oracle job.

Do not answer the user's request directly yet.

Hard requirements:
- Do not plan instead of submitting. The point of `/oracle` is dispatch.
- Do not claim preflight, auth, archive prep, or submission happened unless the matching tool call actually happened in this turn.
- If the user explicitly says ChatGPT Instant or Instant, use provider `chatgpt` and preset `instant`; never switch that request to Grok.
- If a required tool call is unavailable or fails, stop and report that exact blocker instead of fabricating progress.
- After a successful or queued `oracle_submit`, your final answer must be only a terse dispatch summary with the job id and response path. Do not ask questions, offer to watch/poll/read, list next steps, or continue working.

Required workflow:
1. Call `oracle_preflight` immediately. If the user says to use Grok, pass `provider: "grok"` to `oracle_preflight`. If the user says to use ChatGPT, pass `provider: "chatgpt"`. If the user says to use ChatGPT Instant, pass `provider: "chatgpt"` and later call `oracle_submit` with `preset: "instant"`. If the user explicitly provides an existing ChatGPT conversation id or `https://chatgpt.com/c/...` URL, pass it as `chatGptConversationId` to `oracle_preflight` and force `provider: "chatgpt"`. Omit `chatGptConversationId` unless the user explicitly asks to continue an existing browser-created ChatGPT thread.
2. If `oracle_preflight` reports `ready: false`, stop before any expensive prep. Do not read files, search the codebase, prepare archive inputs, or call `oracle_auth` automatically. Report the blocking issue plus the suggested next step.
3. Understand the request and decide whether it is explicitly narrow or genuinely broad.
4. Gather enough repo context to choose archive inputs and write a strong oracle prompt. Bias toward context-rich submissions when they fit within the provider archive ceiling: 250 MiB for ChatGPT, 200 MiB for Grok.
5. If the user scope is explicit and narrow, start from the directly relevant area but still include nearby files, tests, docs, configs, and adjacent modules when they may improve answer quality. Keep the archive tightly minimal only when the user explicitly asks for that, privacy/sensitivity requires it, or size pressure forces it.
6. If the request is broad, architectural, release-oriented, or otherwise repo-wide, gather broader context and usually archive `.`.
7. Choose archive inputs for the oracle job.
8. Craft a concise but complete oracle prompt for the selected web provider.
9. Call `oracle_submit` with the prompt and exact archive inputs. Include `chatGptConversationId` only when the user explicitly provided an existing ChatGPT conversation id/URL to continue; otherwise omit it so the default remains a fresh oracle thread. Do not ask for confirmation before this submit step unless `oracle_preflight` or `oracle_submit` returns a blocker that requires user action.
10. Stop immediately after dispatching the oracle job. “Stop” means no follow-up questions, no offers to poll/watch/read, and no extra next-step list.

Oracle provider/model (`oracle_submit`):
- If the user says to use Grok (for example “Use the oracle to Grok about ...”), pass **`provider: "grok"`**. Grok currently supports only **`mode: "heavy"`**; omit `mode` unless the user explicitly says Heavy.
- If the user says ChatGPT, pass **`provider: "chatgpt"`**. Never route a ChatGPT request to Grok.
- If the user provides an existing ChatGPT conversation id such as `6a28ab5c-e4d4-83e8-b8be-dd39f38a26d6` or a `https://chatgpt.com/c/...` URL, pass it as **`chatGptConversationId`** to both `oracle_preflight` and `oracle_submit`, and pass **`provider: "chatgpt"`**. This is only for explicit existing browser-created ChatGPT threads; omit it for normal `/oracle` jobs.
- Otherwise omit **`provider`** to use the configured default provider, or pass **`provider: "chatgpt"`** only when needed for clarity.
- To choose a specific ChatGPT model, pass **`preset`** with one of the allowed ids from the canonical preset registry.
- Matching human-readable preset labels and common hyphen/space variants are also accepted and normalized automatically, but prefer canonical ids when readily available.
- **Or** omit **`preset`** entirely to use the configured default model (from oracle config).
- For ChatGPT, **`preset`** is the only model-selection parameter. Do not pass `modelFamily`, `effort`, or `autoSwitchToThinking`.
- If unsure, omit **`preset`** and use the configured default. Ask the user about model choice only when they explicitly want model control or the choice would materially change the result.

Rules:
- Use `oracle_preflight` before any expensive `/oracle` preparation so missing persisted-session or local auth/config blockers fail fast.
- If ChatGPT/Grok login is required, the worker said to rerun `/oracle-auth`, or stale auth clearly blocked execution, stop and tell the user to run `/oracle-auth` (or `/oracle-auth grok` for Grok). Do not call `oracle_auth` automatically from `/oracle`.
- Always include an archive. Do not submit without context files.
- By default, prefer context-rich archives up to the provider ceiling because more relevant context is usually better than less. The ceiling is 250 MiB for ChatGPT and 200 MiB for Grok. For broad or unclear requests, include the whole repository by passing `.`. Default archive exclusions apply automatically, including common bulky outputs and obvious credentials/private data like `.env` files, key material, credential dotfiles, local database files, and nested `secrets/` directories anywhere in the repo.
- Only limit file selection if the user explicitly requests a tight archive, if privacy/sensitivity requires it, or if the archive would otherwise exceed the size limit after exclusions/pruning.
- For targeted asks, still include directly related surrounding files, tests, docs, configs, and adjacent modules when they may improve answer quality. Do not default to a one-file archive just because the user mentioned one file, one function, or one stack trace.
- Do not keep exploring once you already have enough context to submit well.
- If the request depends on git state or pending changes (for example code review, ship readiness, or release approval), create a tracked diff bundle file inside the repo (for example under `.pi/`) containing `git status` plus `git diff` output, include that file in the archive, and tell the oracle to use it because the `.git` directory is not included in oracle exports.
- When `files=["."]` and the post-exclusion archive is still too large, submit automatically prunes the largest nested directories matching generic generated-output names like `build/`, `dist/`, `out/`, `coverage/`, and `tmp/` outside obvious source roots like `src/` and `lib/` until the archive fits or no candidate remains. Successful submissions report what was pruned.
- If a submitted oracle job later fails because upload is rejected, retry with a smaller archive in this order: (1) remove the largest obviously irrelevant/generated content, (2) if still too large, include modified files plus adjacent files plus directly relevant subtrees, (3) if still too large, explain the cut or ask the user.
- If `oracle_submit` fails before dispatch with `details.error.code === "archive_too_large"` or an upload-limit message, that failure is retryable. Use the reported top-level size summary and any auto-pruned paths to choose a smaller archive and retry automatically.
- For archive-too-large retries, cut scope in this order: (1) if you used `.`, remove the largest obviously irrelevant/generated/history/export/report content while preserving relevant source/docs/config/tests, (2) if it still does not fit, archive only the directly relevant subtrees plus adjacent docs/tests/config, (3) if it still does not fit after at most two total `oracle_submit` attempts, report what you cut and why.
- Prefer the configured default (omit **`preset`**) unless the task clearly needs a different model or the user explicitly asked for one; then choose a canonical **`preset`** id.
- For any other `oracle_submit` submit-time error, stop and report the error. Do not retry automatically.
- If `oracle_submit` returns a queued job instead of an immediately dispatched one, treat that as success and end your turn exactly the same way.
- After a successful or queued `oracle_submit`, end your turn. Do not keep working while the oracle runs. If `oracle_submit` failed with a retryable archive-too-large error, shrink the archive and retry first.
